# bw-replayview

Basic canvas based replay viewer for prototyping

Under development is the data format for "rich replay data" dumped from BWAPI.

Run this app with "parcel index.html" and drag and drop any replay.bin file, see examples: [bw-replay-example-bins](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/bw-replay-example-bins)
